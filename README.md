# HashMap-JSON-Project
Project that uses HashMap data structure in order to get specific values from JSON file that I use GSON API in order to break down into objects to store as parameters for records. 

In this project I created a HashMap table in order to get specific values from  JSON files provided to me.  I utilize maven in order add Gson API Dependency that would be used to separate values listed into objects that I can use as parameters for a record

I utilize several functions in order to get different answers based on the requirements. Some functions returned values pertaining to the the row count while others returned values pertaining to the money value. A majority of these functions utilize Java 8 streams since they are so functional and simpler to read. 

The notable features this code includes is: 
* Spring Framework Utilization
* Java 8 streams
* HashMap table data structure
* Integration of a json file type into project
* Utilization of Gson API
* Creation and development of Maven Java file
* Utilization of Java records
